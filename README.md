What are the most important tasks? 

## Getting Started ##
1) Download git for your os
2) create a repository with **git init** 
3) check out an existing repository with **git clone [path]** 

## Working with Git ## 
Your local repository consists of three "trees" maintained by git.
The first one is your _Working Directory_ which holds the actual files
The second one is the _Index_ which acts as a staging area
The third one is the _HEAD_ which points to the last commit you've made

To get changes from your local repository up on the Github platform you need to do these three steps: 
1) Propose changes to the INDEX by using **git add [filename]**
2) To get it from the INDEX to the HEAD you need to commit these changes by using **git commit -m"insert your message here"**
3) finally, to get it pushed to the live Github platform, use **git push** (gets to the master branch)
